# simpsons-coding-challenge

This project is intended as an exercise for a simple simple application that provides a basic UI and RESTful API.

The application is build on Spring Boot with an H2 in-memory database. There is no implementation of Spring Security, but this could be achieved easily.

The UI can be accessed at
http://localhost:8083

The Swagger built API documentation can be accessed at
http://localhost:8083/v2/api-docs

A nicer version of the documentation is available at:
http://localhost:8083/swagger-ui.html

There is one REST controller, please access the documentation for instructions on using the different endpoints.
